## Final Project Description ##

For our final project we are supposed to showcase our proficiency in coding and design,
bringing in what we have learned both the first and second semester. 

We were free to choose what to make, as long as we fulfill all the technical requirements, 
and so I have chosen to make a Basic Secure Automatic Door Admission Security System('BadAss')

I have to use only HTML, CSS and Javascript for the coding of the project - webpack as a bundler
and firebase authentication for login/logout function. I have to use minimum 1 API, include logic
as search, filtering, sorting or any other component related to the project.
Forms need to be validated, website has to be responsive and errors must be handled.

It will be updated using git and remote repositories, and will be designed in figma.
